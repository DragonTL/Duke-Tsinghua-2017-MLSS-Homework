day5 is the homework i hand on today(2017/8/1)!
and the documents in the filter day5 are discribed below:

1. test filter contains the results of different models,such as:
result_rnn denotes the result corresponding to RNN;
result_gru denotes the result corresponding to GRU;
result_lstm denotes the result corresponding to LSTM;
result_rnn_Adam denotes the result corresponding to RNN with AdamOptimizer;
result_rnn_GradientDescentOptimizer denotes the result corresponding to RNN with GradientDescentOptimizer;
and the last two results are a comparison of the affect of different optimizers.


2. I have made up the code corresponding to #to do in main,model and rnn_cell.
